## What is GraphQL
GraphQl is a query language that can be used to develop APIs which uses a different approach than the trditional REST APIs. Unlike traditional REST APIs GraphQl allows the client to specify which data required and thus allowing multiple queries in a single request. This helps to develop light weight manageable APIs.
